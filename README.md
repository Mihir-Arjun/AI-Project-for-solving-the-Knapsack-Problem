# Knapsack Problem solver using a Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a genetic algorithm and a genetic algorithm using a local search in order to solve instances of the Knapsack Problem, an optimization problem where items with weights and values must be selected to maximize value while staying within a given weight limit.

## Technical Setup

To find out more about how this project has been set up and my findings please read the report available above.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java files: This can be done by either running the main in your IDE of choice or executing the jar files. The command for those jar files are as follows:
java -jar .\GA.jar 
java -jar .\GA"&"LS.jar
Note: with using this option you will not be able to change the problem instance or the seed values


## Customization

- You can customize the problem instance by changing the input file (eg. `knapPI_1_100_1000_1`) and it's corresponding seed value as found in either the Report or as conveniently provided at the top of both mains. Sections where these values can be replaced are clearly marked and can be found at the top of each main.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
